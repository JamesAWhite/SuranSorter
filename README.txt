Suran Sorter
Sorts a specified file and outputs sorted list to another file

Tested using python 3.8.2 and Ubuntu

In your python terminal, use cd to navigate to the folder containing Suran Sorter and the file you wish to sort
EX: cd /mnt/c/users/USERNAME/desktop/suransorter/

Use python to execute suransorter.py, specifying the file to be sorted
EX: python3 suransorter.py "Sort Me.txt"

An optional argument "-r" or "--reverse" can be used to sort the names in reverse order.
EX: python3 suransorter.py "Sort Me.txt" -r

A file called "Sorted Names.txt" will be created containing a list of sorted names,
replacing any duplicate files.
